1. type "run sinTest" to check the pitch estimation with sinusoid as input
   type "run wavTest" to check the pitch estimation with .wav file as input
   which is in the data/*.wav
2.the voice toolbox provide a pitch tracker function, so we could use it as   a comparison
a. copy refTest.m into directory voicebox, as well as the .wav file
b. type "run refTest.m" under Matlab enviroment.
c. the output to the console is pe which represent the pitch estimation.

3.pitchfft.m: calculate the autocorrelation by fft method
  pitchNor.m: calculate the autocorrelation by normal method, shift,producti  on and sum.
  voiDetect:  decide the start point and end point of speech by calculating   the short-time-energy and zero-crossing-rate.
